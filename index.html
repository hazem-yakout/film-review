        <p>When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native
            humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers knowledge, of the Indigenous Race and their Culture, for the cooperating
            military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity. While Jake begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the
            beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora. </p>

        <p>Drowning in a sea of grief 51 painful weeks after the life-altering incident that scarred her for life, emotionally fragile rock climber Becky reluctantly decides to confront her fears, and as her thrill-seeking friend Hunter re-enters Becky's
            ruined life, the two experienced climbers embark on a high-risk climbing adventure to the top of the abandoned 2,000-foot B67 TV tower: an anxiety-inducing, vertigo-inspiring construction of weather-beaten metal and rattling rivets in the
            middle of the Mojave desert. However, when the peril-laden climb doesn't go as planned, the women must summon up every last ounce of courage and strength to devise a plan for a safe return home or die. </p>

        <p>84 years later, a 100 year-old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater tells the story to her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert, Brock Lovett, Lewis Bodine, Bobby Buell and Anatoly Mikailavich on the Keldysh about her life set in April 10th 1912, on a ship
            called Titanic when young Rose boards the departing ship with the upper-class passengers and her mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater, and her fianc√©, Caledon Hockley. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De
            Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. And she explains the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning.</p>
